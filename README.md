    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This system is developed to monitor and track the movement of people, cars, bikes, and bicycles using cameras. 
       Upon detecting a person approaching sufficiently close, the system will capture a screenshot, process facial recognition, and if the person is unidentified, it will send an alarm via email.</p>
